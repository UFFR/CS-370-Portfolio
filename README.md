# CS-370-Portfolio
Repo for CS-370

- *Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?*
  - All of the code except for the main training loop was already provided. I implemented the training loop, as outlined by the provided pseudocode. The code was also designed to integrate with the preexisting code properly.
- *What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?*
  - The role of a computer scientist is to design and implement software systems that solve complex problems efficiently and effectively. Modern society heavily relies on technology in every industry, so software must be implemented well, in addition to avoiding ethical issues that could harm society instead of benefitting it.
- *How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?*
  - First, the user's needs and requirements must be identified to create an outline for the solution. Then I break down the problem into constituent parts that are easier to solve and eventually integrate them into a cohesive, single solution. The exact process varies, depending on the specific situation, of course. If difficulty is encountered, I discuss and collaborate with others in the field to gain more insight and develop multiple alternatives to try.
- *What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?*
  - Besides the responsibilities of managing user data and privacy according to the law and basic morals (depending on the context), a most paramount responsibility is to have the software package be fully functional, in terms of actual functionality and being bug-free. Of course, it is not always possible to make a perfect piece of software in the first attempt, especially very complex ones, but a reasonable attempt must be made to ensure the satisfaction of the end user and the success of the organization I belong to.
